# FCSlib
Functional C# library, originally developed for my book Functional Programming in C#

This is the first release to github and nuget. Should hopefully find some time soon to add a bunch of tests I have around somewhere and do a bit of updating/maintenance! Meanwhile, have fun with the current code!
